# La Fortuna Restaurant
Simple landing page for a Spanish Restaurant to put into practice and showcase my knowledge of CSS Grid. Please click on the following link to see the [deployed project](https://la-fortuna-jk27.netlify.app).
It is fully responsive for all different screen sizes and devices as you can see on [Am I Responsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https://la-fortuna-jk27.netlify.app "La Fortuna Restaurant responsiveness").

# Usage
The project is intended to have very basic functionality:
- The three buttons in in the header (only displaying on larger screens) scroll down to the corresponding section of the page.
- Clicking on the links for each of the menus (Restaurant and Food Truck) will open the corresponding menu in a new tab on PDF format.
